# Week one homework - sjb-w1-homework

This weeks task was to review and refactor existing HTML and CSS code to meet accessablitiy standards and meet the marketing agency's acceptance criteria.

## Questions/Challenges

Best practices for or class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
I have a few questions around best practices for setting out CSS and naming conventions.
- What is the best way to learn industry base class naming conventions? Is there a general rule for naming custom class/id names?
- Do you have any cheatsheets that we can build our own base list from to have as quick reference?
- Do section specific classes follow up the section styles or are they later in the CSS?

I originally had the alt tag in the service sections with the same text as the headers, when using an accessibility tool I got a comment that the alt tag for the services were redundant so i change this to describe what was taking place in the images. Can you please tell me what is better practice? Following the section titles or description of the image?
